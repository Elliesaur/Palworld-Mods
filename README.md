# Palworld-Mods
Palworld is a newer game but mods are ramping up, here's some good mods made by me and others that are popular.

# Installing Mods
- Mods shown here are to be added to your "Mods" folder inside your Palworld install.
- To install mods simply clone the repo, or download as zip.
- Once downloaded, extract all items to your Palworld installation -> Pal folder -> Binaries -> Win64 folder.
- Start Palworld from Steam
- Console will open in background, mods are enabled in Mods/mods.txt
- This uses UE4SS for mod support.

# Mods
- Higher Durability (Numpad 3) - Adds a lot of durability to weapons (pickaxes, axes, guns, etc) and armor. Does NOT add bullets/arrows/etc.
